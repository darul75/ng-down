=====================

AngularJS directive bottom page trigger.

Why
-------------

I was using it for pagination feature when user has reached bottom of page.

Relatively simple but effective.

Demo
-------------

Installation
------------

Using npm:

```
npm install ng-down
```

How to use it
-------------

You should already have script required for Angular, note sanitize module use.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="angular.min.js"></script>
```

to the list above, you should add:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="ng-down.min.css">
```

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="ng-down.min.js"></script>
```

Then, inject `ngDown` in your application module:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['ngDown']);
```

and then just put on dom element directive name `when-bottom` and `action` scope function attribute.

```html
<div when-bottom action='currentFn()' timer='3000'>
```

'action' your scope function which will be triggered when scrolling down.

### Options

* `timer`: 'timer' lock is ms, to avoid many call

assuming you already have `grunt` installed, otherwise you also need to do:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
